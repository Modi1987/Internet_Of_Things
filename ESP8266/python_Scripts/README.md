# About:
This folder contains various micropython scripts (programs) for ESP8266.
Copy those scripts into ESP8266 inside the folder (/pyboard) using the following command from rshell:

`cp naemOfFily.py /pybpard`

Afterwards, you can run each script from inside (repl) using:

`import scriptToRun`

Or you can specify the script to run on boot by adding a script (main.py) into the folder (/pyboard) that includes the same previous line code:

`import scriptToRun`
