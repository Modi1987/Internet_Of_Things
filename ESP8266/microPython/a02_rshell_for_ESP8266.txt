# MICROPYTHON has its own shell, it is called
# (repl), you can access it through serial port
# by connecting to it from PC through PuTTY.
# But, for more advanced usage, it is recommened 
# to use (rshell), it is a fully fledged shell that
# allows advanced functionalities, for example copying
# files from PC to ESP8266.

# To install (rshell), from command line type:
sudo pip3 install rshell

# To run rshell, from command line type:
sudo rshell --buffer-size=30 -p /dev/ttyUSB0

# To list files on ESP8266 from inside 
# (rshell) type the following:
ls /pyboard

# To copy a file from PC to ESP8266,
# from insdide rshell type:
cp  NAMEandPATH_Of_File_On_PC /pyboard

# To add a script to startup,
# create a main.py, that includes:
import NAME_of_Script_to_Run_on_Startup

# Then copy the files (main.py) and
# (NAME_of_Script_to_Run_on_Startup.py)
# to ESP8266

# To run (repl) from inside (rshell) type
repl

# Special commands for repl,
